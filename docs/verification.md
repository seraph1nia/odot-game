# Cooperative POC verification

Verified on 2026-09-30 on Linux x86_64 using .NET SDK 10.0.401 and Godot 4.7.2 .NET. Graphical checks used real X11 windows under KDE Wayland with the Compatibility renderer and an AMD Radeon RX 6800. Windows/macOS runtime checks and the remote GitHub Actions runner have not been executed.

## Rules and real processes

`mise run test` passes 17 cases. They cover one-to-four-player initialization, snapshot serialization, fixed rosters, atomic owned-slot spending, recruitment and upgrades, disconnected production, ready/unready, unique turn guards, retry identity, bounded deterministic combat, weak defense, simultaneous damage/deaths, immediate enemy conservation and remainder distribution, original-roster future allocations, persistent soldier/city damage, nine production turns, victory/defeat precedence and pause without catch-up. A pause/disconnect/resume regression proves that an already eligible ready check resolves once on resume.

The final real ENet suite passes using separate headless Godot processes and standard balance. It verifies:

- Two authenticated cities, start/build/upgrade/production/recruitment, sender ownership, foreign/invalid/occupied/unaffordable/wrong-phase/stale-turn requests, ready editing restrictions and unready.
- Malformed and excessive requests without disrupting the other client, old protocol refusal, fixed-roster late-join refusal, invalid/expired credentials and concurrent credential claims.
- Client B exits during combat; the city remains and combat advances. Client A pauses; a replacement B process gets a different ENet peer but the same city, economy, buildings, army and frozen gameplay. Replaying accepted recruitment before and after restart spends once. Pause revisions and connections remain observable; resume continues the simulation.
- A normal two-client farm-upgrade/barracks strategy wins all three waves, retains army state and refuses further turns.
- Three clients under-defend one city until it falls in actual combat. Surviving clients agree on conserved enemy IDs/remaining damage and changed destinations. The next wave allocates 18 enemies, 9 per survivor. The fallen player resumes as an observer and can pause/resume without reviving.
- An ordinary no-building strategy ends in defeat; unavailable/stopped servers, occupied ports, missing readiness and exited children produce bounded feedback.

There is no resource-grant, damage, kill-city or teleport RPC. Automated clients send normal requests through the same handlers as the UI. Suite default is 180 seconds, with a 15-second startup deadline and endpoint/timeout overrides. Network, export-smoke and dev sessions use separate owned temporary directories and clean them on exit. Diagnostics contain public identity/state and command results, never resume tokens.

## Clean source, CI and exports

The ordered `mise run ci` pipeline passes after the final reconnect fix (about 128 seconds): locked restore, formatting, build/import, 17 rules cases, the complete cooperative network suite, template verification, Linux client/server exports and exported gameplay smoke. The smoke starts a match, buys a farm/barracks, produces food and recruits through the normal protocol. Both exports are gated by the checks; the workflow still has no upload, release, publishing or deployment step.

The first verification copy contained only tracked/nonignored source, with no build/import caches. Full CI passed there. After the lifecycle fix, the final CI ran against the updated identical source; source hashes did not change through import/export. Generated `.godot`, `bin` and `obj` directories were then removed from that owned copy and final fresh-source preparation passed again. Asset manifest SHA-256 checks and every external glTF buffer/texture dependency were checked independently. The minimal vendored subset is approximately 1 MB; no runtime downloads are needed.

The verified client/server outputs are available in ignored `dist/client` and `dist/server`. Graphical exported clients run from their packed resources with no `--path` source argument. Dedicated-server resource stripping preserves the normal gameplay protocol; headless roles do not instantiate cameras, UI or KayKit models. Asset import and normal headless scenarios have no visual-loading errors. The deliberate occupied-port failure retains its expected engine diagnostic.

## Graphical interaction and lifecycle

Rendered source windows were driven with Godot mouse-input events through their actual controls: Start, square-board ray selection, sidebar slot selection, farm purchase/upgrade, barracks purchase, explicit recruitment, Ready and shared Pause/Resume. They produced normal server acknowledgments and matching resource/army/phase state in the other window. Ordinary economic commands continued longer battles. Captures were inspected for original model materials, square placement, resource props, distinct blue soldiers/red enemies, defender shots, automatic movement/casualties, fallen cities and terminal presentation.

Source clients retained an open frozen scene across disconnect and resumed with their session. Exported clients additionally exercised the visible Reconnect button during a paused battle and repeated reconnects in the lobby. The final lifecycle has no signal errors in those runs. This required untracking the shared RPC node through a real tree exit before replacing its transport; the view stays as a sibling and `/root/Game` is restored. This avoids the export template's RPC cache cleanup mismatch without patching the engine or changing the protocol.

The graphical source losing strategy intentionally stopped recruiting for one city, showed its elimination and the survivor's increased wave pressure, and ended at a shared defeat screen. The graphical export scenario used three original cities, let one fall, and had the survivors add a second upgraded farm and upgrade their barracks to pay for the redistributed later waves. It also checked the eliminated observer's board/outcome and viewing another player's city with editing disabled.

The physical pointer/device path on this KDE Wayland host was not independently verified: graphical widget checks used injected Godot input. These are actual rendered-widget and normal-RPC checks, distinct from headless gameplay tests. Windows/macOS graphics, network impairment, server restart recovery, account security and host migration are outside the executed POC checks; recovery is limited to the same running server.

## Launch and cleanup

The actual `mise run dev --port 17633` task was started twice. Both runs prepared the project, started one headless server and two connected graphical clients with distinct fresh session files. SIGTERM stopped only the owned children, removed their temporary sessions and released the port; a second run reached a fresh lobby instead of reusing expired credentials.

Independent `mise run server --port 17634` and `mise run client --port 17634 --session-file .sessions/role-verification.json` commands were exercised. The client bought a farm with ordinary requests, exited, and was relaunched with its exact command while the server stayed alive. Resume verification compared the public stable identity, changed peer and retained purchase. Final shutdown/session cleanup affects only those owned verification processes/files.

The exported survivors won with 100 city health and nine remaining soldiers each; the eliminated third player received the same victory.
