# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Cursor-anchored tabletop zoom
Graphical clients SHALL support scroll-wheel zoom in and out over the visible world area. Wheel up SHALL zoom in and wheel down SHALL zoom out while retaining the angled orthographic projection. The ground-plane point beneath the cursor SHALL remain at the same screen position during zoom unless maintaining that anchor would exceed the camera's travel bounds. Zoom SHALL have finite close and overview limits; input beyond a limit SHALL leave the view unchanged. Scrolling over the HUD or an open dialog SHALL NOT zoom the world.

#### Scenario: Zoom toward an off-center point
- **WHEN** the player scrolls up over an off-center world point with room inside the travel bounds
- **THEN** the world appears larger and the ground-plane point under the cursor stays at the same screen position
- **AND** scrolling down reverses the scale change without changing camera orientation

#### Scenario: Reach a zoom limit
- **WHEN** the player continues scrolling in a direction after reaching that zoom limit
- **THEN** neither camera scale nor position changes

#### Scenario: Scroll over controls
- **WHEN** the player scrolls over the bottom panel or while a dialog is open
- **THEN** the world camera remains unchanged and the UI retains its normal scrolling behavior

### Requirement: Keyboard tabletop panning
Graphical clients SHALL support continuous camera panning while WASD or arrow keys are held during world interaction. W/up and S/down SHALL move the view toward the top and bottom of the screen across the tabletop ground plane; A/left and D/right SHALL move left and right. Equivalent bindings SHALL have equivalent effects, diagonals SHALL NOT move faster than cardinal directions, and movement SHALL be independent of frame rate. Camera travel SHALL be bounded around the observed city while preserving camera height and orientation.

#### Scenario: Hold and release a direction
- **WHEN** the player holds D or right arrow during world interaction and then releases it
- **THEN** the view pans right while held and stops on release
- **AND** the camera does not rotate or change height

#### Scenario: Move diagonally and reach the edge
- **WHEN** the player holds two perpendicular pan directions and continues toward the travel boundary
- **THEN** diagonal speed does not exceed cardinal speed and the view stops at the boundary

### Requirement: Local camera input and lifecycle
Camera navigation SHALL be local presentation state and SHALL NOT submit gameplay commands or alter authoritative state. Modal dialogs, focused UI controls consuming navigation keys, text entry and an unfocused game window SHALL take priority over camera navigation. Losing focus or opening a modal SHALL stop held camera movement without stale movement resuming when input returns. Camera navigation SHALL remain usable over an available city view during shared pause, transport loss and outcome screens. Projected unit health bars SHALL follow camera changes even when combat playback is frozen.

#### Scenario: UI receives navigation keys
- **WHEN** a text field, dropdown or other focused UI control consumes a camera-bound key
- **THEN** that control responds normally and the camera does not move from that key

#### Scenario: Interrupt a held direction
- **WHEN** the window loses focus or a modal opens while a pan key is held
- **THEN** camera movement stops and does not resume until a new eligible press after release

#### Scenario: Inspect a paused or disconnected battle
- **WHEN** the player navigates an available paused or disconnected city view
- **THEN** camera navigation and health-bar projection respond while combat poses, health and authoritative gameplay remain frozen

### Requirement: Recoverable camera overview
Graphical clients SHALL expose a visible Reset view control that restores the fitted overview of the observed city. Entering a tabletop, switching to a different city or receiving a fresh match SHALL initialize the overview and clear held navigation. Resizing the window or changing HUD height SHALL recompute the fitted base view and preserve the player's relative zoom and city-relative pan within current limits. Reconnecting to the same match and observed city in the same tabletop SHALL retain camera adjustments; camera state SHALL NOT persist across application launches.

#### Scenario: Reset a close view
- **WHEN** the player activates Reset view after zooming and panning
- **THEN** the observed city's fitted overview is restored with all plots and the battle approach above the HUD
- **AND** world selection and resources are unchanged

#### Scenario: Switch city or match
- **WHEN** the observed city changes or a fresh match replaces the current match
- **THEN** the new city's overview is shown without inheriting the previous city's pan or zoom

#### Scenario: Resize an adjusted view
- **WHEN** the window or HUD size changes while the player has adjusted the view
- **THEN** the relative zoom and city-relative pan are preserved within limits against the recalculated base framing
- **AND** Reset view still restores a fully fitted overview

#### Scenario: Reconnect within the same view
- **WHEN** the client reconnects to the same match and observed city without replacing its tabletop
- **THEN** its camera adjustments are retained and rebuilt world targets remain selectable

### Requirement: World interaction after camera navigation
Hover and selection SHALL resolve the currently visible plot or building to its existing slot after camera navigation. Navigation SHALL NOT spend resources, change world selection or enable editing a foreign city. Screen-space overlays SHALL remain aligned with their world anchors and SHALL NOT intercept world input. Source and exported graphical clients SHALL provide the same camera controls; headless roles SHALL NOT instantiate camera presentation.

#### Scenario: Select a building after moving
- **WHEN** the player zooms and pans and then clicks a visible building roof
- **THEN** the same authoritative slot is selected and its contextual controls are displayed
- **AND** resources are spent only after an explicit eligible gameplay action

#### Scenario: Inspect a foreign city closely
- **WHEN** the player navigates a foreign city's view and selects one of its visible plots
- **THEN** the observed plot is identified while spending controls remain unavailable

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Lower camera and readable composition
Graphical clients SHALL use a slightly lower angled orthographic view that reveals building faces and terrain depth. At the default or reset overview at the default 1100x820 window size and at 1280x720, the focused city's nine plots, home/defender, and full battle approach SHALL fit in the world area above the bottom panel and every plot SHALL be selectable. Deliberate zoom or pan SHALL be allowed to place some world objects outside the visible world area, with Reset view restoring the complete composition. Tall scenery SHALL NOT conceal buildable plots or active combat in the overview, and the panel SHALL keep essential actions and feedback accessible without horizontal clipping.

#### Scenario: Inspect a fully built city
- **WHEN** a city has buildings in all nine plots, including level-two buildings, at either supported verification size and the camera is at its default or reset overview
- **THEN** each building can be selected in the world and the battle approach remains visible above the bottom panel
- **AND** resources, contextual actions, and match controls remain readable and reachable

#### Scenario: Observe four-player combat
- **WHEN** a four-player match reaches combat and the player switches between cities
- **THEN** each focused city starts at a consistent overview with its soldiers, attackers, and defender feedback visible
- **AND** scenery does not conceal the combat or change the displayed authoritative destinations
